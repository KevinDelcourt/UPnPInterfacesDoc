# UPnP Interfaces

These documents aim at describing and giving code examples related to the interfaces used in the following components project : 
- https://github.com/KevinDelcourt/DesktopUpnpComponents
- https://github.com/KevinDelcourt/UPnPAndroidComponents
- https://github.com/KevinDelcourt/UPnPAndroidMap
- https://github.com/KevinDelcourt/UPnPAndroidGPS

Those projects are meant to be used with [OCE](https://github.com/SylvieTrouilhet/OCE)

For every interface, we will provide a description of its actions and its arguments. As well as code examples, for both using a component implementing the interface and creating a component implementing the interface. Those examples are made on projects with the [UPnPComponents utility library](https://github.com/KevinDelcourt/UPnPComponents), based on [Cling](http://4thline.org/projects/cling/core/manual/cling-core-manual.xhtml).
